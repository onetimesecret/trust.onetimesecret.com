// The site's sitemap-of-record and per-section lifecycle. Kept in code rather
// than trust.yaml on purpose: readiness is an operational concern, whereas
// trust.yaml is published verbatim at /trust.yaml for procurement tooling to
// diff — a "status: draft" flag has no place in that artifact.
//
// One `status` field toggles a section everywhere it appears: routing, the
// header nav, the overview index, and the XML sitemap. The lifecycle only ever
// moves forward, so content grows onto the site as it matures — no "coming
// soon" placeholder is possible, because an unready section is simply absent:
//
//   draft     — in the repo, never shipped. Rendered during the build, then its
//               output is pruned (see astro.config.mjs) so the deployed URL
//               returns a real 404. Absent from nav, index, and sitemap.
//   unlisted  — built and reachable by direct URL (a soft-launch / review lane:
//               share the link with one reviewer or customer), but omitted from
//               nav, the overview index, and the sitemap.
//   published — fully live: built, in the sitemap, and (when it carries a
//               navLabel) in the nav and on the overview index.
//
// The build reconciles what it emitted against this registry and fails if they
// disagree (a live section with no page, a page no section claims, or a draft
// that wasn't pruned), so this file cannot silently drift from the deployed
// site. See the trust:reconcile-and-prune integration in astro.config.mjs.
